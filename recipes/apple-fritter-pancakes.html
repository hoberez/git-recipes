    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Apple fritter pancakes make a wonderful breakfast topped with some warmed maple syrup 
        and served with some breakfast meats. You can use any type of apple for this recipeâ€”
        I used Honeycrisp (Fuji works great, too), but the sweeter the better. If you are 
        using a tart apple, add another tablespoon of sugar.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded apple</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine egg, sugar cinammon, ginger, nutmeg, kosher salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl.
            Whisk until well combined and lightly foamy. Add shredded apple and lemon juice and fold
            in with a spatula until well combined. Add flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix until
            flour disappears and batter is thick yet spoonable.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add tablespoonfuls of apple batter to the hot butter
            and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until apple pancakes spring back to the
            touch and are browned on the other side, an additional 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
